## Project Choice

```Memory Card Game```

## Project Description

In this Unit 1 Project I am creating a Halloween themed Memory Card Game. I will be using the DOM manipulation technique, HTML CSS, and JavaScript. It will include a win/lose condition and be deployed online. In the game you will have a 5x4 grid of cards that will need to be matched based on how well your memory is. If you get 5 unmatched cards you lose. In the future, I would like to improve the game by adding music and levels of difficulty.

## User Story                                                         

***MVP Goals:***

- As a player, I want the game to display a grid of cards all face-down at the start.

- As a player, I want the card to flip over and reveal its image when i click on it.

- As a player, I want both cards to stay face-up when i click on another card and it matches the first one. 

- As a player, I want both cards to flip back over if they do not match.

- As a player, I want the game to track the number of wrong flips.

- As a player, I would like to be able to restart the game if I win or lose.

***Stretch Goals:***

- As a player, I would like there to be a sound effect when I flip over a card.

- As a player, I would like to have a main start window when I begin the game.

- As a player, I would like there to be levels of difficulty.
